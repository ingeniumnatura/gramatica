### Systematic Vocabulary & Grammar Practice  

After unexpectedly moving to a Spanish speaking country and needing to quickly learn the language, I developed this systematic approach to memorizing vocabulary. Between this approach and immersion, I achived a conversational level of speaking and advanced reading comprehension in a few months.  

It applies a continuous skip-gram model to a Spanish text dataset that is used as input to software that updates a personalized profile to optimize vocabulary acquisition.
